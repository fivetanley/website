  Ember Meetup Assets

<p>

  We've created Meetup group badges and branding to help give our groups a consistent feel. You can create your own by 
  <a href="/images/meetups/EmberMeetUp_180x135.psd">downloading the PSD</a>. We've got some other materials in the works and will post them here and email the organizers' Google Group as things come together.

  <p>
    The Ember Core Team has a small stash of Ember stickers donated by the folks at <a href="http://tilde.io">Tilde</a>. These are distributed as requested while in stock. If you'd like to print your own Ember stickers, here are the files you'll need for the canonical ones.
